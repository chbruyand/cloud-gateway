Description: Cloud Gateway turns any Cloud storage into a local volume.
 Our software gateway connects any Cloud storage service including Amazon S3
 and Openstack compatible providers. No API integration is required, data is
 stored on the Cloud, encrypted during transfers and can be replicated between
 multiple Clouds. Your Cloud storage area works as a local filesystem that you
 can export as a NAS through NFS, CIFS...
